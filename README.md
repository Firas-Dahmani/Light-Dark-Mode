# [Light Dark Mode](https://firas-dahmani.github.io/Light-Dark-Mode/)

This project allows users to toggle the theme of the page from light to dark and from dark to light. The project also considers when a user exist a page by mistake or intentially, the browser will recall how the state of the website was left by the user. if user would like for the them to be as is dark or light the browers will recall this state each time the user visits the website. The project is made possible through JS and CSS.

## Thoughts

I was always interested in implementing a light and dark theme for a project. I assumed it was going to be a lot harder than it actually was. This was done in relatively few lines of code really. I would like to try to implement this into some of my old projects as well as some upcoming ones.
